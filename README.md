## Description

The purpose of this project is, with the help of video analytics, check whether the people are maintaining social distancing or not as it is a vital part of avoiding spread of any contagious virus.

<font size="4"> **Some Information about YOLO**</font>

YOLO is an abbreviation for the term â€˜You Only Look Onceâ€™. This is an algorithm that detects and recognizes various objects in a picture (in real-time). Object detection in YOLO is done as a regression problem and provides the class probabilities of the detected images.

**Why the YOLO algorithm is important**

YOLO algorithm is important because of the following reasons:

- **Speed**: This algorithm improves the speed of detection because it can predict objects in real-time.
- **High accuracy**: YOLO is a predictive technique that provides accurate results with minimal background errors.
- **Learning capabilities**: The algorithm has excellent learning capabilities that enable it to learn the representations of objects and apply them in object detection.

<font size="4"> **Deep SORT Tracking**</font>

The most popular and one of the most widely used, elegant object tracking framework is Deep SORT, an extension to SORT (Simple Real time Tracker).

<font size="4"> **Euclidean Distance**</font>

 The Euclidean distance between two points in Euclidean space is the length of a line segment between the two points. It can be calculated from the Cartesian coordinates of the points using the Pythagorean theorem, therefore occasionally being called the Pythagorean distance.

#### **Technologies**

- Python
- OpenCV
- DeepSORT
- YoloV3

#### **Project Flow**
1. Video frame is passed to the YoloV3 model which returns with the bounding boxs.
2. Centroid is calculated for the bounding box.
3. Euclidean Distance is calculated with all the bounding boxs and determine distance between them.
